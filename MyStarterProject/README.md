# MyStarterProject
This folder contains app_L1105, which is the source code for a simple MSPM0L1105 microcontroller project.

To use, create a folder with your desired project name (i.e. instead of **MyStarterProject**, call it (say) **MotorController** or **LEDController** etc).

Inside that folder, place the app_L1105 folder.

If you're using Linux or Max, you'll also need the set_env.sh file, place it anywhere convenient.

Next, go inside the app_L1105 folder and follow the README.md file there, which explains how to set up your PC for building the MSPM0L1105 project.
